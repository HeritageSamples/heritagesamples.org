# Welcome to the Heritage Samples Registry

The **Heritage Samples Registry** is an emerging international initiative to
support the persistent identification, discovery, and sharing of information
about material samples in the context of heritage science. These samples — including paint cross-sections,
material fragments, reference standards, and other physical specimens — are
valuable research assets that underpin conservation, technical analysis, and
education worldwide.

The Registry aims to make the existence of these samples **findable, citable,
and consistently documented**, enabling researchers and institutions to connect
local sample records with global research outputs.

## What this site provides

This documentation website offers:

### **Introduction to IGSNs**

A clear explanation of the International Generic Sample Number (IGSN) system,
how IGSN–DOIs work, and why they are suitable for identifying heritage samples.

### **Registry Schema and Metadata Structure**

An overview of the draft metadata schema used for registering samples, including
which fields are required, how local identifiers are handled, and how the schema
extends IGSN-DOI requirements for heritage contexts.

### **Instructions for Contributors**

Guidance for institutions, laboratories, and researchers on how to:

- prepare sample metadata,
- submit sample records,
- register interest in participating,
- integrate the Registry into existing documentation systems.

### **Consortium Information**

Details about the organisations currently supporting the initiative, and how
institutions can join the consortium as it grows.

## Current status

The Registry is under active development with international partners.  
During this phase the goals are to:

- test the metadata model with a diverse set of real sample records,
- refine workflows for assigning IGSN–DOIs to heritage samples,
- gather feedback from institutions and researchers,
- build a sustainable governance and technical framework for long-term use.

As work progresses, additional sections of this documentation will be expanded
to include validation tools, implementation examples, and community guidelines.

## Get involved

Institutions or researchers interested in contributing to the development of the
Registry, or in assigning IGSNs to their heritage samples, are warmly invited to
contact the project team.

📧 **info@heritagesamples.org**

Your feedback, expertise, and participation will help shape a shared,
international approach to heritage sample documentation and identification.
