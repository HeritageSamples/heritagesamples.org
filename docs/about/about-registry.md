# About the Heritage Samples Registry

<img style="float: right" hspace="20" width="128px" src="../../images/hs-logo_v1.3-dark.png"/>

The **Heritage Sample Registry (HSR)** is a collaborative initiative to create a sustainable and interoperable registry for heritage samples, built on the [**International Generic Sample Number (IGSN)**](https://ev.igsn.org/) system. Each IGSN is a [**Digital Object Identifier (DOI)**](https://www.doi.org/), providing a persistent, globally resolvable reference that connects physical samples to the international DOI network and supports reliable cross-referencing in publications and data resources. 

Developed within the framework of [**E-RIHS (European Research Infrastructure for Heritage Science)**](https://www.e-rihs.eu/), the work draws on developments begun under [**IPERION HS**](https://www.iperionhs.eu/) and is now supported through [**ECHOES**](https://www.echoes-eccch.eu/) and [**RICHeS**](https://www.riches.ukri.org/). The HSR will provide a common mechanism for the identification and citation of physical heritage samples, beginning with **paint cross-sections**. Each sample will be assigned a unique IGSN and a minimal descriptive record, enabling it to be referenced unambiguously across multiple systems and publications. 

The registry will form the foundation for **digital twin representations** of heritage samples, providing a persistent link between the physical sample and its digital surrogates, including analytical data and related documentation held elsewhere.

## **Purpose and Rationale** 

Heritage science increasingly depends on access to data from small but significant physical samples that are analysed, reused, and reinterpreted across institutions and decades of research. Despite their importance, these samples often lack consistent public identifiers, making it difficult to trace their provenance, usage, or analytical history. 

The HSR addresses this problem by: 

- Assigning a **persistent IGSN-DOI** to each sample, ensuring long-term traceability and interoperability. 

- Providing a **shared metadata structure** aligned with the default IGSN and DataCite schemas, with limited heritage-specific extensions (such as sample location on an object or sample type). 

- Supporting the creation of **digital twins**, linking physical samples to their related digital resources in external systems. 

- Offering a **federated registry** that allows institutions to register and manage identifiers locally while contributing to an international reference index. 

- Enabling connections to institutional collection management systems and open research repositories through standard APIs and linked data practices. 

It is important to emphasise that the registry will not host analytical results, publications, or detailed documentation. Its sole function is to provide authoritative identifiers and core metadata to support interoperability across the broader digital ecosystem of heritage science.
