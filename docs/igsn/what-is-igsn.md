The International Generic Sample Number (IGSN) is a globally unique and persistent identifier (PID) governed by the [IGSN e.V.](https://ev.igsn.org/home) and registered through the DataCite infrastructure. It is designed for<br/>the unambiguous identification of an individual sample, an aggregation of samples, or a feature-of-interest to ensure the reliable citation, discovery, and linkage between sample metadata and its relevant research outputs across the internet. <br />
