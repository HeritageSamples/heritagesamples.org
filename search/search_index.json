Each IGSN is a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), providing a persistent, globally resolvable reference that connects physical samples to the international DOI network and supports reliable cross-referencing in publications and data resources.</p> <p>Developed within the framework of E-RIHS (European Research Infrastructure for Heritage Science), the work draws on developments begun under IPERION HS and is now supported through ECHOES and RICHeS. The HSR will provide a common mechanism for the identification and citation of physical heritage samples, beginning with paint cross-sections. Each sample will be assigned a unique IGSN and a minimal descriptive record, enabling it to be referenced unambiguously across multiple systems and publications.</p> <p>The registry will form the foundation for digital twin representations of heritage samples, providing a persistent link between the physical sample and its digital surrogates, including analytical data and related documentation held elsewhere.</p> <pre><code>---\nconfig:\n  layout: fixed\n---\nflowchart LR\n    A@{ label: \"&lt;img src=\\\"https://heritagesamples.github.io/heritagesamples.org/images/sample_vial.jpg\\\" width=\\\"64\\\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Physical Heritage Sample\" } --&gt; HSR@{ label: \"&lt;img src=\\\"https://heritagesamples.github.io/heritagesamples.org/images/hs-logo_v1.3-dark.png\\\" width=\\\"72\\\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heritage Samples Registry&lt;br&gt;IGSN\u2013DOI Assignment\" }\n    HSR --&gt; B@{ label: \"&lt;img src=\\\"https://heritagesamples.github.io/heritagesamples.org/images/metadata-card.png\\\" width=\\\"64\\\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Minimal Core Metadata Record\" } &amp; IGSN@{ label: \"&lt;img src=\\\"https://heritagesamples.github.io/heritagesamples.org/images/igsn.jpg\\\" width=\\\"64\\\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;IGSN-DOI Identifier\" }\n    IGSN --&gt; DOI@{ label: \"&lt;img src=\\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/DOI_logo.svg\\\" width=\\\"64\\\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;DOI Infrastructure\" }\n    B --&gt; IGSN\n    C@{ label: \"&lt;img src=\\\"https://heritagesamples.github.io/heritagesamples.org/images/data.png\\\" width=\\\"64\\\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;External Data&lt;br&gt;Images, Analysis, Documentation\" } -. references .-&gt; IGSN\n    D@{ label: \"&lt;img src=\\\"https://heritagesamples.github.io/heritagesamples.org/images/publications.png\\\" width=\\\"64\\\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publications &amp;amp; Reports\" } -. references .-&gt; IGSN\n    E@{ label: \"&lt;img src=\\\"https://heritagesamples.github.io/heritagesamples.org/images/DigitalTwin.png\\\" width=\\\"64\\\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital Twin Representations\" } -. references .-&gt; IGSN\n    C -. may also have .-&gt; DOI\n    D -. may also have .-&gt; DOI\n    E -. may also have .-&gt; DOI\n\n    A@{ shape: rect}\n    HSR@{ shape: rect}\n    B@{ shape: rect}\n    IGSN@{ shape: rect}\n    DOI@{ shape: rect}\n    C@{ shape: rect}\n    D@{ shape: rect}\n    E@{ shape: rect}\n     A:::object\n     HSR:::digital2\n     B:::dims2\n     IGSN:::name2\n     DOI:::digital2\n     C:::infoobj\n     D:::document\n     E:::infoobj\n    classDef object stroke:#2C5D98,fill:#2C5D98,color:#FFFFFF,rx:5px,ry:5px,font-size:18px,font-weight:bold\n    classDef digital2 stroke:#999,fill:#eee,color:black,rx:5px,ry:5px,font-size:18px,font-weight:bold\n    classDef name2 stroke:orange,fill:#FEF3BA,color:black,rx:20px,ry:20px,font-size:18px,font-weight:bold\n    classDef infoobj stroke:#907010,fill:#fffa40,color:black,rx:20px,ry:20px,font-size:18px,font-weight:bold\n    classDef document stroke:#2C5D98,fill:#33B0FF,color:#2C5D98,rx:5px,ry:5px,font-size:18px,font-weight:bold\n    classDef dims2 stroke:black,fill:#c6c6c6,color:black,rx:20px,ry:20px,font-size:18px,font-weight:bold</code></pre>"},{"location":"about/about-registry/#purpose-and-rationale","title":"Purpose and Rationale","text":"<p>Heritage science increasingly depends on access to data from small but significant physical samples that are analysed, reused, and reinterpreted across institutions and decades of research.
